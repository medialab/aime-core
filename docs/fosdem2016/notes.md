# Notes

## Viz use cases

* Duplication of lone reference documents.
* Misattribution of translation links.

## Points

* Description of the enquiry's graph so we can elaborate.
* Show how a flat table graph structure might work.
* Present `agent-smith` as a POC, not as a completed app.
* Schéma de refacto.
* Histoire de l'adoption (Heiko => Heikki => Dor => Yomgui).
* Cypher is the main selling point.

## Problems encountered

* Ordered links.
* Maintenance.
* Lucene interface.

## Plan

1. AIME's presentation
2. Data model of the inquiry
3. MySQL and the tree
4. The multiplication of databases and the heavy stack
5. Schema de refacto
6. Neo4j data model (outil de Benoît)
7. Agent Smith vs. the old admin and the new one
8. Migration
9. Feedback Neo4j
10. Quinoa / Dolman / Decypher
