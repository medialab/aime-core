  "terms.introduction.content": "Bruno Latour, a Professor at Sciences Po, has received a research grant from the European Research Council (ERC) for the purpose of exploring and proposing a new description of what is meant by the phrase to modernize. This new description is presented in the book Enquête sur les modes d'existence (An Inquiry into Modes of Existence) and on the digital platform that accompanies the printed publication. Many of the formulations proposed in the book would benefit from being critiqued, verified or reformulated in order to observe a) whether they correspond to shareable experience, and b) whether other, improved formulations of the proposals might be possible. Your participation in this project means that you agree to take part in this philosophical and diplomatic exercise and that you are prepared to share your experiences, your contributions and your criticisms with a view to these disagreements being published (in the form of booklets, websites and/or installations, depending on the progress of the investigation and decisions made by mediators). (For more information, see the Project Description page). Our site, AIME (property of the National Foundation of Political Science, referred to hereinafter as FNSP) intends to develop and maintain an online community willing to continue the investigation initiated by the printed book, and to give each visitor the opportunity, notably, to publish information, videos, pictures, sound clips and to recommend sites or web pages in the Proposition Environment space (and the forthcoming Reaction Environment).
